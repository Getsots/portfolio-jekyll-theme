```
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```
# Creating a dataset
data = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
        'Values': [23, 45, 12, 34]}

# Converting to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the data
df
```


```
# Visualizing the data
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(df['Category'], df['Values'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Sample Data Visualization')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.show()
```
